#WANDERLUST

Wanderlust is a full-fledged hotel and resort listing and booking platform. It allows users to browse, list, and book hotels and resorts with comprehensive authentication and authorization features. Built using the MERN stack, this application ensures a seamless and secure experience for both users and service providers.

Inspiration

Wanderlust was inspired by popular platforms like Airbnb but with the goal of being a more simplified and user-friendly version. The platform is designed to reach even third-tier cities, allowing property owners from underrepresented regions to list their properties, unlike Airbnb which often targets more urbanized areas of society.

Purpose

This project was created to test and apply my learning and knowledge of frontend and backend development technologies. It serves as a practical implementation of the MERN stack, combining everything I've learned in web development.

Features

    User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely using JWT-based authentication.
    Hotel/Resort Listings: Users can browse through a range of hotels and resorts listed on the platform.
    Booking System: Customers can book hotels and resorts directly from the platform.
    CRUD Functionality for Listings: Logged-in users can create, update, and delete their hotel or resort listings.
    Reviews: Customers can review hotels and resorts after booking.
    Authorization: Only authorized users can manage their listings, bookings, and reviews.
